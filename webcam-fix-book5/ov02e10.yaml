# Tuning file for OmniVision OV02E10 on Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake)
# Used by libcamera's Simple pipeline handler / Software ISP
#
# The OV02E10 has a red+blue bias that causes a purple tint with
# symmetric CCMs. This file boosts green more than R/B to compensate.
# Use tune-ccm.sh to interactively find the best color preset.
